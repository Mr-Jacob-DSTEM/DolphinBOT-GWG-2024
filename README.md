# DolphinBOT-GWG-2024
Very basic example chatbot written in python for our Grow with Google AI Day.
---------------------------------------------------
This project is a simple python chatbot written to show how you can use functions and conditionals to make your chatbot 'conversate'!
AI doesn't have to be scary to learn when you remember that at it's core its just logic & algorithms. 
You can use this code as an example while making your own DolphinBOT project!
